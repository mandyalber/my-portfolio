            <h2>Hi! I'm Amanda Alber</h2>
            <img class="portrait" src="images/mandy.jpg" alt="photo of mandy" />
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer currently learning at Thinkful Coding Bootcamp. I'm located
                in Tacoma, Washington (about 40 minutes south of Seattle).</p>
            <p>What can I help you create?</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>As a former accountant and data professional, I began my journey into coding when I was looking
                to find a job that wouldn't leave me watching the clock all day. While I enjoyed my roles as an
                accounting professional and a data specialist, I was searching for something that would allow me
                more flexibility, autonomy and the opportunity to continually learn new things.</p>
            <p>After dabbling online and then taking a few college classes, I was hooked! As a Thinkful student,
                I am reaping the benefits of collaborating with a mentor and other students to propel me to my
                next career.</p>
            <p>I have a Web Programming Certificate that demonstrates my experience with HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript, as well as exposure to Java, C++, PHP, SQL and Joomla! CMS (Content Management
                System). I am continually learning new things and look forward to creating quality projects.</p>
            <h3>Services I can provide:</h3>

            <p>Outside of development, I spend my time playing with my two sons, taking long walks outdoors and
                reading books about self-improvement, psychology and sociology.</p>
